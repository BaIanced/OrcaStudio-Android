# Changelog

> Orca-Android was developed with an AI coding assistant (Claude, Anthropic); see the
> [AI disclosure](README.md#ai-disclosure) in the README.

## 0.1.2

- Profile updates download only the files that changed (seconds instead of minutes) and run in
  the background while the app stays usable.

## 0.1.1

- The plate, presets and setting changes are saved when the app goes to the background and come
  back on the next start.
- Device tab: a one-line status bar above the printer's web UI instead of a side column, so
  Mainsail/Fluidd get the full width.
- The printer status says why it is missing instead of waiting forever; the preview says when a
  connection (web UI only) cannot receive prints.
- Filament colours are the same on the plate, in the G-code, thumbnails and saved projects.
- Fixes from testing: object settings no longer count the filament assignment as a change,
  OrcaSlicer's error messages and units are translated, back from a preset comparison returns to
  the preset, the settings search gets the focus, single-key shortcuts no longer fire in editors,
  projects are named after the first object.

## 0.1.0 — first release

First public version, based on OrcaSlicer 2.5.0-dev (commit `2769b12`).

  export and comparison; profile updates from the OrcaSlicer repository.
- Prepare: plates, arrange, auto-orient, lay on face, transforms, cut, split, simplify, repair,
  measure, undo/redo; modifiers, blockers, enforcers and negative volumes; per-object, per-part and
  height-range settings; painting of supports, seams, fuzzy skin and colours; variable layer
  height; pauses, filament changes and custom G-code; shapes, text and SVG.
- All calibration tests of the desktop.
- 3MF projects compatible with the desktop, STL export, G-code and `.gcode.3mf` export.
- Toolpath preview with layer and move sliders, colour schemes, statistics and G-code view;
  external G-code files.
- Printing via Klipper/Moonraker, OctoPrint, PrusaLink, Duet, Repetier, ESP3D, MKS and Bambu Lab
  LAN; the printer's web interface in the Device tab; progress notification.
